                Effective Date: January 2025
            </p>

            <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>
                By engaging with Cyphacore AI for development, automation, or consulting services, you agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, you must not use our services.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Scope of Services</h3>
            <p>Cyphacore AI provides two distinct categories of services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Development Services:</strong> One-time builds including Websites, Mobile Applications (Android/iOS), Custom Software, and standalone AI Agents.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation Services:</strong> Recurring subscription-based services for workflow automation (n8n), maintenance, and hosting.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any request beyond the agreed scope (e.g., additional app features, new workflow logic, or extra integrations) will be treated as a Change Request and may incur additional fees.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>For Development Projects:</strong> A deposit (typically 50%) is required to commence work. The remaining balance is due upon project completion or defined milestones. Code and assets are released only upon full payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>For Automation Subscriptions:</strong> Monthly fees are billed in advance. Failure to pay may result in the immediate suspension of automation workflows and support. Setup fees are non-refundable once work has commenced.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Client Ownership:</strong> Upon full payment, the Client owns all rights, title, and interest in the custom code, designs, and content created specifically for their project (e.g., your Website or Mobile App source code).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cyphacore IP:</strong> We retain ownership of our background technology, pre-existing libraries, automation frameworks, and reusable tools used to deliver the service. You are granted a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use these components within your project.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Workflow Limits & Fair Use</h3>
            <p>
                For Automation Plans, "Workflows" are defined by logical processes. Cyphacore AI reserves the right to limit or renegotiate plans if a client's usage (e.g., server load, API calls) significantly exceeds standard fair use policies or impacts other clients.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Revisions & Approvals</h3>
            <p>
                Development projects include a set number of revision rounds as defined in the specific proposal. Additional revisions outside the original scope are billed at our standard hourly rate. Once a milestone is approved by the Client, further changes to that milestone are considered new work.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Warranty & Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Development:</strong> We provide a 30-day warranty period after delivery to fix any bugs related to our code. This does not cover issues caused by third-party updates (e.g., iOS updates, API changes) or client modifications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Automation:</strong> Ongoing maintenance is provided only for active subscribers. If a subscription is cancelled, we are not responsible for the continued operation of the workflows.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p>
                We respect your privacy. All client data, business logic, and credentials shared with Cyphacore AI are treated as strictly confidential and will never be shared with third parties without your consent, except as required by law.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>
                Cyphacore AI shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including data loss, business interruption, or lost profits, arising from the use of our software or services.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Termination</h3>
            <p>
                Either party may terminate the agreement with written notice. For Development Projects, the Client is liable for all work completed up to the termination date. For Subscriptions, cancellation stops the next billing cycle; no partial refunds are issued.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Contact</h3>
            <p>
